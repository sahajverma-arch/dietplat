/**
 * Formats a recipe item's grams as a household portion measure.
 *
 * The vocabulary is a direct dietitian specification (the "Portion-size
 * reference"), previously implemented only in a hand-built presentation
 * page and never in the product itself — which is why generated PDFs
 * disagreed with it. Three tiers, in order:
 *
 *   1. A whole fruit that's genuinely eaten by the piece  -> "2 apples"
 *   2. A discrete countable item (dosa, idli, roti, cutlet) -> "3 pieces"
 *   3. Everything else (curry, dal, rice, chutney, salad)   -> container size
 *
 * Tier 3's scale, exactly as specified:
 *   spoonful <40g · small serving 40-100g · small bowl 100-200g ·
 *   bowl 200-300g · large bowl 300-450g · plate 450g+
 *
 * This REPLACES the earlier convention of echoing whatever unit noun the
 * source CSV happened to carry ("1 katori", "2 glasses", "2 rices"). That
 * was faithful to the ingested data but not to how a dietitian writes a
 * plan, and it produced real nonsense on some rows — "2 rices" for Kuttu
 * Kadhi With Samak Chawal, "6 pieces" for a 25 g-per-piece sushi.
 *
 * Grams are shown alongside the measure ("bowl, 205 g"), matching the
 * specification's own worked examples. This reverses an earlier
 * "grams are never shown alongside" choice, which was made back when the
 * label was always a self-anchoring count like "2 rotis"; a container word
 * on its own ("bowl") is not actionable without the gram figure behind it.

/**
 * Fruits counted by the piece under their own name ("2 apples"), not by

 * inferred from the data, for two reasons found by profiling the real
 * ingested rows:
 *
 *  - Apple and Banana are both ingested as unitLabel "bowl" (150 g), so
 *    there is no per-row flag that already says "count this one by the
 *    piece" — the tier is a dietitian judgment about the food, not a
 *    property of the source data.
 *  - Generalising to every Fruit-category row is actively wrong: Grapes is
 *    ingested at 1 g per unit (-> "120 grapes"), and the mixed-fruit-bowl
 *    rows ("All-Season Mix Fruit Bowl") are bowls by definition.
 *
 * Green Apple is absent on purpose — it carries no per-unit weight at all
 * in this dataset, so it has no honest piece count and falls to tier 3.
 * Matched case-insensitively on the recipe's whole name.
