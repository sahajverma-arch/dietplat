/**
 * Ranking for the best-of-N generation strategy: given several independently
 * generated candidate weeks, which one best matches the client's target?
 *
 * Lives outside recipe-selector.ts purely so it is unit-testable — that file
 * imports openai-client.ts, which validates server env at module load. Same
 * separation as recipe-day-diagnosis.ts / recipe-validate.ts.
 *
 * WHY MEAN DEVIATION OF THE WEEKLY AVERAGE, and nothing else. Measured on
 * real runs, a single-call week lands 0-2 of 7 days inside the per-day
 * tolerance, so ranking on "days passing" would mostly compare zeroes and
 * decide the winner by noise. The weekly average is both the quantity the
 * best-of-N path actually gates on and a continuous signal that separates
 * candidates cleanly. Plausibility and variety counts are deliberately NOT
 * folded into the score — mixing them in would quietly reintroduce the
 * per-day gate this strategy exists to replace, and they are surfaced as
 * warnings instead.
